  <section id="abstract">
  <p>This document describes the morphology module of the Lexicon Model for Ontologies as a result of the work of the Ontology Lexicon community group (OntoLex-Morph). The module is targeted at the representation of linguistic morphology in dictionaries and and other linguistic resources, as well as the formalization of rules for word formation and inflection as employed in computational morphology and grammatical appendices as frequently provided as part of bilingual dictionaries.</p>
  <p>This module operates in combination with the lemon core module and extends it with support for two distinct views on linguistic morphology:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li><p>OntoLex-Morph allows to enrich lexical entries and individual forms with information about the morphological units that they consist of (descriptive morphology). This improves the capability of OntoLex-Lemon to encode, preserve and document the structure of morphologically complex forms or lexical entries.</p></li>
  <li><p>OntoLex-Morph allows to formalize morphological rules that can be used to produce complex lexical entries and inflected forms from their component morphs, resp., their base forms (generative morphology). This allows to extend OntoLex-Lemon resources with a framework that describes how to produce and analyze complex lexical entries or inflected forms.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>OntoLex-Morph has been designed with the premise to make OntoLex-lemon applicable to morphologically rich languages of any type, supporting both fusional and agglutinating morphology, and thereby contributing to a truly multilingual web.</p>
  The RDF file with the OntoLex lemon lexicography module can be found at http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph

  <section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Morphology is a vital and, in many languages, very sophisticated part of language, and as such it has been an important part of the work of lexicographers. In the traditional print form, morphological information is provided in brief abbreviated terms that can only be deciphered with significant knowledge of the language, however with the transformation of the dictionary to an electronic resource a re-imagining of the morphology information in a dictionary is certainly due.</p>
  <p>The morphology module aims at fulfilling two modelling purposes:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Stating elements that are involved in the decomposition of lexical entries and forms.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Morphological decomposition on the lexical entry level.<br/> scope: The kind of elements of which a lexical entry can consist should be as non-restrictive as possible. I.e. The decomposition of lexical entries encompass lexical entries, components, derivational affixes, inflectional affixes, stems, roots and zero morphs. However, a lexical entry can NEVER be composed of a form!</p></li>
  <li><p>Morphological decomposition on the form level.<br/> scope: Elements of which a form can consist include roots, stems, inflectional affixes and zero morphs.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="2" type="1">
  <li>Enabling the representation of building patterns that are involved in the formation of lexical entries and forms.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
  <li>Representation of decompositional building patterns for lexical entries.</li>
  <li>Representation of decompositional building patterns for forms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A fine-grained description of phonological and morphophonological processes that are involved in any kind of stem or word formation on the phoneme level is excluded and not representable with this Morphology Module. Only the elements between the lexical entry and the morph levels will be covered. It is possible, however, that such information may be addressed in future OntoLex modules.</p>
  <p>The OntoLex-Morph module aims to be adequate for both traditional dictionary content (which contains only abbreviated information about morphological rules and paradigms, often organized in appendices) and structured computational data (morphological dictionaries) as used in Language Technology, with the goal of making resources from one community more accessible to the other.</p>
  <section id="overall-structure">
  <h2>Overall structure</h2>
  <p>OntoLex-Morph is designed to account for</p>
  <ul>
  <li>morphological inflection, derivation and compounding,</li>
  <li>languages with fusional or agglutinating morphology,</li>
  <li>the morphological structure of any given form or lexeme (extensional morphology, morphological segments),</li>
  <li>morphemes, rules and selectional constraints associated with them</li>
  <li>both the structural and the semantic aspects of morphemes and rules,</li>
  <li>various data sources, including, but not limited to lexical resources, inflection tables and computational morphologies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>OntoLex-Morph was intended for (but is not limited to) the following primary use cases:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>formalize morphological rules to generate context-adequate labels for and human-language descriptions from ontologies and knowledge graphs</li>
  <li>provide a machine-readable view on morphological data (examples, rules) as found in grammars, text books and dictionaries</li>
  <li>formalize computational morphologies in an interoperable and standard way so that they can be more easily ported between different implementations</li>
  <li>represent morphological relations between lexical entries and forms as a knowledge graph</li>
  <li>complement static dictionaries with dynamic rules to generate possible surface forms</li>
  <li>more easily combine any of these resources with each other and other lexical datasets (as provided in OntoLex)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At its core, OntoLex-Morph operates with three main classes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><em>morph</em> formalizes the morphological segmentation of lexical entries and forms.</li>
  <li><em>rule</em> formalizes the morphological rules that constitute lexical entries and forms from underlying base forms.</li>
  <li><em>grammatical meaning</em> formalizes semantic and morphosyntactic features of and constraints on morphs and rules.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They are related with each other and with OntoLex in the following way:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A morph is a lexical entry in the sense of OntoLex. It involves a set of lexical or base forms and a set of meanings (senses). For dependent morphs that can only be characterized by their grammatical meaning, the set of senses can be empty.</li>
  <li>A rule typically <em>involves</em> a morph whose application to a given base form is represented by the rule.</li>
  <li>A morph, a rule or the <code>ontolex:Form</code> that results from the application of these to a base form can have a <em>grammatical meaning</em>.</li>
  <li>The grammatical meaning is understood as a feature bundle that describes morphosyntactic, morphological or semantic features of the resulting form. It can be elucidated by Lexinfo properties (for morphosyntactic features) or OntoLex lexical concepts (for semantic constraints), but this is not obligatory.</li>
  <li>A morph or a rule can specificy necessary conditions for their application to a particular base form as a <em>base constraint</em>. The base constraint is formalized as a grammatical meaning object. By comparing a base constraint with the grammatical meaning of a base, an implementing system should be able to validate the applicability of a rule or morph to that base.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Individual morphological processes (derivation, compounding, inflection) and their relation to lexical entries and forms are represented by designated subclasses of <code>ontolex:Rule</code> as described below.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Limitations: OntoLex-Morph is designed with a focus on deep morphology. Morphophonological rules <em>can</em> be modelled with OntoLex-Morph to a certain extent, but we expect phenomena such as assimilation, dissimilation and morphological “Level-2” rules to be more adequately handled by a separate vocabulary specialized in surface generation (transcription, text-to-speech, morphophonology).</p>

  <p><strong>morph:GrammaticalMeaning</strong> can be used to represent (bundles of) values of different morpho-syntactic or morpho-semantic features expressed by a form, morph or rule (e.g., value ‘nominative’ for feature ‘case’, value ‘singular’ for feature ‘number’, etc.; or the feature bundle composed by the latter two values, in a fusional language where they are expressed cumulatively, e.g. Latin)</p>

  <p>For instance, the segmentation into morphs of the english plural form <em>cats</em>, and the assignment of grammatical meaning to the form and to the corresponding plural morph, can be expressed in this way.</p>
  <aside class="example" title="Example: Segmentation of the English plural form *cats*">
  <pre class="turtle"><code>:cats a ontolex:Form ;

  MI: This was <code>morph:grammaticalMeaning lexinfo:plural</code>, but I don’t think this should be valid
  </div>
  <p>In this case we create a blank node for the grammatical meaning that corresponds to a single feature in Lexinfo. In practice, it might be better to define instances for common morphological meanings and reuse these objects.</p>
  <p>For example, in the Latin form <em>lupus</em>, nominative case and singular number are expressed cumulatively by the affix <em>-us</em>. This is a common combination, therefore, an instance of morph:GrammaticalMeaning is introduced for that feature bundle. This time we use Lexinfo vocabulary alongside with Paralex vocabulary — even though Lexinfo is the preferred way to represent grammatical features in OntoLex, there is no restriction on this.</p>

  <p>Discussion/History:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>the extension to forms was introduced 2022-02-23 per request from Penny and Matteo for more conveniently providing re-usable and directly indexable “feature bundles”.</li>
  <li>the eLex-2019 draft had <code>morph:meaning</code> in a comparable function, but with Morph being subclass of LexicalEntry, this role is taken over by <code>ontolex:sense</code>.</li>
  <li>in spring 2022, it was requested by Penny and Katerina to make this a property of <code>morph:InflectionRule</code> as a short-hand for <code>morph:involves/morph:grammaticalMeaning</code>.</li>
  <li>as of 2022-10-19, it was agreed to attach this property also to <code>morph:Rule</code>. For circumstances in which no explicit morph can be provided (but only a rule), e.g., because a resource comes without an explicit notion of morph(eme)s, there would not be a way to express the meaning or function of that morpheme, otherwise.</li>
  <li>question (CC, 2022-10-24): do we need this for <code>morph:InflectionType</code> ? This would be useful to express that a certain “slot” contains information of a particular kind, e.g., morphological gender or morphological number. Right now, this information is implicit (in the inflection rules assigned to a particular inflection type).</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="entity">
  <p>baseConstraint (ObjectProperty)</p>
  <p><strong>URI:</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#baseConstraint">http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#baseConstraint</a></p>
  <p><strong>morph:baseConstraint</strong> defines the grammatical characteristics of the stem or base that a derivational or inflectional morpheme can be combined with</p>
  <div class="description">
  <p>Domain: ontolex:Morph or morph:Rule</p>
  <p>Range: morph:GrammaticalMeaning</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>For example, an element for nominal inflection can only be applied to nouns, and derivational affixes can have similar constraints. Note that such information is not applicable to an <code>ontolex:Form</code> because this describes only the result of the application of a rule or the addition of a particular form.</p>
  <p>As a concrete example, the fact that the English affix -s expresses plural number if attached to nouns, and 3rd person singular agreement if attached to verbs, can be coded as follows using morph:baseConstraint.</p>
  <aside class="example" title="Example: Base constraints for the English affix -s">
  <pre class="turtle"><code>:-s_pl a ontolex:Affix ;
    morph:grammaticalMeaning lexinfo:plural ;
    morph:baseConstraint lexinfo:noun .

:-s_3sg a ontolex:Affix ;
    morph:grammaticalMeaning :3.sg ;
    morph:baseConstraint lexinfo:verb .</code></pre>
  </aside>
  <p>Discussion/History: - CC 2022-10-24: by analogy with morph:grammaticalMeaning, this property should also be applicable to rules to specify necessary preconditions.</p>

  <p><strong>URI:</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#baseForm">http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#baseForm</a></p>
  <p><strong>baseForm</strong> is a subproperty of <code>ontolex:lexicalForm</code> that indicates the form that is taken as base for the application of inflection or derivation rules to generate other forms.</p>

  <p>Domain: <code>ontolex:Word</code> (not lexical entry!)</p>

  </div>
  <p>This property is necessary in cases in which inflection or derivation relations do not take the canonical form as their basis, but a different one. One example is German verbal inflection (e.g., for <code>gehen</code> “to go”), where the canonical form (<code>gehen</code>, infinitive) is derived from the base form (<code>geh-</code>, stem) by means of a suffix (<code>-en</code>, infinitive marker), like other inflected forms (<code>geh</code>, <code>gehst</code>, <code>geht</code> “I/you go; he/she/it goes”).</p>

  <p><strong>morph:Rule</strong> represents the formal operation applied to a base form to obtain another form (inflectionally or derivationally related to it). It must contain either <code>morph:example</code> or <code>morph:replacement</code> (or both). “Tabular” value of a morpheme must be stored in <code>rdfs:label</code> (e.g. “-s”<span class="citation" data-cites="en">@en</span> for usual PL in English). One rule applies exactly one morphological transformation, i.e. adds one Morph.</p>

  As an example, a simple replacement operation would be concatenation, i.e., retrieve the baseForm (or canonicalForm, if no baseForm provided), check that it has the same stem type as the rule (if applicable), then append an affix to the written representation of the baseForm. -->
  <p>This property points to an object that describe the morphological transformation required to produce a valid form according to the rule. Morph module does not limit the exact way to represent these transformations since there are many common ways to do this, therefore, there are no properties in the module to represent that. However, we provide a non-normative option — replacement with regular expressions, which will be used in the examples in the subsequent sections.</p>

  Unless specified otherwise (in the documentation of a resource), implementations SHOULD provide NFD-normalized Unicode strings for <code>morph:source</code> and <code>morph:target</code>, so that diacritics are separated from the base character as combining characters.

  <p><strong>morph:InflectionRule</strong> represents the formal operation applied to a base form of a LexicalEntry to obtain another inflected form of that LexicalEntry.</p>
  <p><strong>morph:inflectionRule</strong> provides information on how to generate inflected forms and, in case of a dataset with pre-generated forms, links these forms to InflectionRules that were used to generate them.

  <p>The example below illustrates the modelling of inflection classes and rules for the generation of the genitive singular of <em>lupus</em> in Latin.</p>

  <p>In a fusional language like Latin, there is no need to have different inflection slots: a single inflection rule (specific for the inflection class to which the lexical entry is assigned) allows for the generation of the genitive singular form as follows:</p>

  <p>On the other hand, in an agglutinative language like Turkish, it is useful to define separate inflection slots for each morphosyntactic feature, and separate inflection rules for each inflection slot, as illustrated in the example below.</p>

  <p>When a software compatible with the specifications runs on this data to generate forms of the entry <code>:adam</code>, it first extracts all the rules associated with the corresponding morphological pattern, namely <code>sg_rule</code>, <code>pl_rule</code>, and <code>acc_rule</code>. Next, it establishes the order of inflection slots mentioned in the rules (by looking for the slot that is not used as an object in a <code>morph:next</code> property).</p>
  <p>Then, for the first inflection slot the correct form is chosen. If there is a <code>morph:baseType</code> specified in the rule, the corresponding form is chosen. Otherwise the canonical form is used. Finally, for each inflection slot, the transformation is applied. For the first slot the initial form is used, after that, the output of one transformation is used as an input for the next.</p>
  <p>With each transformation, all the properties in the grammatical meaning associated with the rule are copied to a newly created grammatical meaning. After all the transformations have been applied, the form is created with the constructed grammatical meaning. The initial form and the morphs are added as objects for the <code>morph:consistsOf</code> statements.</p>
  <p>It is also possible to create Morph elements during generation in case they are not present in the data.</p>
  <div class="note">
  In case if there are no inflecton slots in the rules, the generation proceeds without using them.

  <p>In the case of the example above, the successive application of the two appropriate rules for accusative and plural formation – in the order established by the use of the morph:next property – allows for the generation of the accusative plural form as follows:</p>

  <p>For instance, for Latin verbs, in addition to the citation form, dictionaries also record “principal parts” – i.e., a set of forms from which the full paradigm of a lexeme can be inferred. E.g., the entry for <em>rumpo</em> in the Lewis and Short dictionary lists the forms: - <em>rumpo</em>, displaying the present stem <em>rump-</em>, from which other forms displaying the present stem can be inferred; - <em>rupi</em>, displaying the perfect stem <em>rup-</em>, from which other forms displaying the perfect stem can be inferred; - <em>ruptum</em>, displaying the so-called third stem <em>rupt-</em>, from which other forms displaying the third stem can be inferred;</p>

  <section id="word-formation">
  <h2>Word Formation</h2>
  <section id="word-formation-rules">
  <p>Another important component of morphological structure is word formation. While inflection is concerned with morphologically related forms of the same lexeme(s), word formation is concerned with morphologically related lexemes, focusing on the specific relationships holding between them on the one hand, and on the processes by which derivatives can be obtained from their bases (or from each other) on the other hand. Accordingly, at its core, the modelling of word formation in OntoLex-Morph operates with two main components: - word formation <strong>relations</strong> are established between lexical entries that are morphologically related - word formation <strong>rules</strong> are used to describe the formal instructions involved in the processes of formation of derivatives.</p>
  <p>In the following (sub)sections, these two components are described in detail and exemplified.</p>
  <h2>Word Formation Relations</h2>
  <p>A piece of information regarding word formation that is often provided for both traditional dictionaries and digital morphological resources is which lexical entries are morphologically related: for instance, dictionaries often record the base of morphologically complex lexical entries, as illustrated below in the entry for the Italian noun <em>trattamento</em> ‘treatment’, derived from the verb <em>trattare</em> ‘to treat’ in the online Treccani dictionary.</p>
  <p><strong>trattaménto</strong> s. m. [der. di <em>trattare</em>]</p>
  <p>To be able to not only encode this descriptive information, but also possibly further specifying it by expressing additional details, in OntoLex-Morph word formation relations are reified in a dedicated class, <code>morph:WordFormationRelation</code>. Since word formation relations are relations between different lexical entries, this class is defined as a subclass of the class introduced in the vartrans module of OntoLex for such relations – namely, <code>vartrans:LexicalRelation</code>. As a consequence, vartrans properties are also used to link lexical entries to the relations holding between them: specifically, each word formation relation is linked through <code>vartrans:source</code> to its base(s) and through <code>vartrans:target</code> to the derivative.</p>
  <div class="entity">
  <p>WordFormationRelation (Class)</p>
  <p><strong>URI:</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#WordFormationRelation">http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#WordFormationRelation</a></p>
  <p><strong>morph:WordFormationRelation</strong> is a subclass of <code>vartrans:LexicalRelation</code> that relates two lexical entries that are morphologically related, with the property vartrans:target<code>linking the relation the resulting lexical entry, and the property</code>vartrans:source` linking it to the morphological base (in derivation) or head and other constituents (in compounding).</p>
  <div class="description">
  <p>subClassOf: vartrans:LexicalRelation</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>Accordingly, the morphological derivation of German <em>Schönheit</em> ‘beauty’ can be encoded as follows:</p>
  <aside class="example" title="Example: Derivation of the German noun *Schönheit*">
  <pre class="turtle"><code>:schoenheit-entry a ontolex:LexicalEntry;
             ontolex:canonicalForm [ ontolex:writtenRep &quot;Schönheit&quot;@de ].
:schoen-entry a ontolex:LexicalEntry.
             ontolex:canonicalForm [ ontolex:writtenRep &quot;schön&quot;@de ].
:schoen_heit a morph:WordFormationRelation;
             vartrans:source :schoen-entry;
             vartrans:target :schoenheit-entry.</code></pre>
  </aside>
  <p>The same kind of modelling can be applied to compounds – i.e., lexemes that are morphologically related to two or more bases; e.g. English <em>wallpaper</em>.</p>
  <p>It should be noted that there is another OntoLex module that was envisaged to be usable also for compounding, namely decomp, devised for the decomposition of complex lexical entries (like Multi-Word Expressions) in their parts. However, in OntoLex-decomp the relationship between complex lexical entries and their parts is not reified, as there is no dedicated class, differently than what happens in OntoLex-morph for word formation relations.</p>
  <p>As a consequence, to allow for a parallel treatment of different word formation processes (derivation and compounding), a subclass of <code>morph:WordFormationRelation</code> is introduced for compounding – namely, <code>morph:CompoundingRelation</code>. This can be considered as a reification of the property <code>decomp:subTerm</code>, that can be used to decompose lexical entries into other lexical entries: hence, the existence of a compound relation entails that the source lexical entry is a subterm of the compound. Since, by definition, compounds have more than one base, there will also be more than one compound relation: one relation with the target compound should be introduced for each of the constituents of the compound.</p>
  <div class="entity">
  <p>CompoundRelation (Class)</p>
  <p><strong>URI:</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#CompoundRelation">http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#CompoundRelation</a></p>
  <p><strong>morph:CompoundingRelation</strong> is a <code>morph:WordFormationRelation</code> that connects a (lexical entry representing a) morphological consituent of a compound with the (lexical entry representing the) compound.</p>
  <div class="description">
  <p>subClassOf: morph:WordFormationRelation</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>Furthermore, compounds can have a head – i.e., a constituent that imposes its morphosyntactic and semantic properties to the whole word. For instance, It. <em>capo-stazione</em> ‘station master’ inherits the fact of being a masculine noun denoting a person from its head <em>capo</em> ‘chief’, rather than from the other constituent <em>stazione</em> ‘station’. In morph, a subclass of compound relations is introduced to express this information – namely, <code>morph:CompoundHead</code>.</p>
  <div class="entity">
  <p>CompoundHead (Class)</p>
  <p><strong>URI:</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#CompoundHead">http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#CompoundHead</a></p>
  <p><strong>morph:CompoundHead</strong> is a <code>morph:WordFormationRelation</code> that connects the (lexical entry representing the) morphological head of a compound with the (lexical entry representing the) compound.</p>
  <div class="description">
  <p>subClassOf: morph:CompoundingRelation</p>
  </div>

  <p>Accordingly, the morphological derivation of Italian <em>capostazione</em> ‘station mastes’ (from <em>capo</em> ‘head’ + <em>stazione</em> ‘station’) can be encoded as follows:</p>

  </aside>
  <h3>Word Formation Rules</h3>
  <p>In addition to relations between morphologically related lexemes, one can be interested in expressing the formal instructions needed to generate derived lexemes from their bases. To do that, another sub-class of <code>morph:Rule</code> is introduced, alongside <code>morph:InflectionRule</code>, namely <code>morph:WordFormationRule</code>. Like inflection rules, word formation rules can take as input either the canonical form of the input lexical entry, or another form that is used as base form, and they can involve specific morph(eme)s.</p>
  <div class="entity">
  <p>WordFormationRule (Class)</p>
  <p><strong>URI:</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#WordFormationRule">http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/morph#WordFormationRule</a></p>
  <p><strong>morph:WordFormationRule</strong> represents the formal operation applied to a base form of a source LexicalEntry to obtain another, target LexicalEntry .</p>
  </div>
  <p>Word formation rules can also be related to the word formation relations existing between the lexical entries involved through the property <code>morph:wordFormationRule</code>.</p>
  <div class="entity">
  <p>wordFormationRule (ObjectProperty)</p>

  <div class="description">
  <p>Domain: morph:WordFormationRelation</p>
  <p>Range: morph:WordFormationRule</p>

  <p>Two sub-classes of <code>morph:WordFormationRule</code> are introduced corresponding to the traditional division of the realm of word formation into derivation and compounding.

  <h2>Open questions</h2>
  <p>These are questions we decided to postpone until finalization of the module. Don’t use that for on-going discussions, that’s what minutes are for.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>shouldn’t LexicalEntry (except as superclass of morph:Morph) be an ontolex:Word
  <ul>
  <li>MI: I think there was a discussion about this in the very beginning (about affixes). To check</li>
  <li>CC: PRO: semantics: otherwise everything we define for lexical entry then also applies to <code>morph:Morph</code>, this could be abused in unforeseen ways</li>
  <li>CC: CON: makes a more complicated diagram</li>
  <li>JM: tbc whether there are inflected multi-word expressions (if so =&gt; CON)</li>
  <li>JM: CON: in general, users should be clever enough to figure that out without putting it explicitly into the diagram</li>
  </ul></li>
