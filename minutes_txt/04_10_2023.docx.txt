1. Replacement → RegexReplacement

FK: morph:source and morph:target being string literals can be too strictly
defined given that the model will not be able to change after publication. What
if we relax this restriction, move specifics about regular expressions into
addenda.

… some discussion …

MI: Suggestion — having morph:Replacement underdefined, a new subclass
morph:RegexReplacement which has the properties morph:Replacement has now.

2. Plans

Next time (04.10):

  • 
        Everyone whose issues are on GH are either present or we know the
        status

  • 
        Going through unmet requirements

  • 
        Going through problematic datasets

Time after next (18.10):

  • 
        MP presents the new standard for morphology, its compatibility with
        Morph.
