  • 
        Implement requirement freeze as of today?

      □ 
            Vote today: 11/11 yay

Feature freeze

Not yet, but the following procedure was discussed before:

  • 
        MI: I think we achieved a level where we freeze everything and write it
        up. I think that we can still have limitations unsolved for the final
        module, we just need to explicitly decide

  • 
        Should we vote in mailing list since not everyone is in the call

  • 
        CC and MI should decide when we’re ready to run the vote, then send to
        OntoLex chairs to approve

Character / sound classes

OLD:

    Max and Mike, LDK paper on morph on maltese/semitic

    Problem: /(K)([aeiou]{1,2})(K)([e]{1,2})(K)/\1\3i\5t/

  • 
        Can be done without, but illegible

    Proposal: to add a class representing a character class (e.g. vowels,
    consonants, “sun consonants” — Maltese)

    consonants morph:SoundClass ;

    rdf:label "Sun" ;

    ?:contains "d", "n", “r”, “s”, “t”, “x” .

    consonants morph:SoundClass ;

    rdf:label "Sun" ;

    ?:contains "[dnrstx]" .

  • 
        Data is the Maltese data discussed here before, will be partially
        converted

  • 
        CC: separate module? Together with signs?

  • 
        MI: not about phonology, more about representation; workaround:
        precompile within rule set

  • 
        GS: proposal contains two things:

      □ 
            Mechanism and terminology

  • 
        TF: what is the usecase of mimicking finite state paradigms

  • 
        CC: interoperability with dictrionaries and “text book rules”

  • 
        MI: rules motivated from minimizing the inventory (rules instead of
        full forms). That was a requirement from the beginning

  • 
        Mike: question of what we want morph, necessary for languages where
        orthography mapping is not 1:1

  • 
        GS: strip out heuristics, focus on description how language changes
        strings

  • 
        MI: not implementing FST, just using the means (a very small part) to
        encode rules for generating wordforms

  • 
        GS: morphology describes transformations, so we need that

  • 
        CC: let the proposal sink in for a few weeks, if there are additional
        use cases that really require this within morph, we could implement it,
        the need and motivation is clear. Not fully convinced that modelling
        should be restricted to morph

  • 
        Mike: will be discussed in paper

morph:baseConstraint

  • 
        morph:baseConstraint — found only in one example with Inuktitut
        generation.

    In a nutshell, morph:baseConstraint can be used to provide prerequisites
    for a morph to be compatible. For example

    :m1 morph:baseConstraint [ :pos "v" ] .

    sets the requirement for the word that this morph can be added to. And
    morph:grammaticalMeaning holds grammatical categories for the morph itself,
    as before. But shouldn’t it be only for a Rule, not for a Morph?

LDL challenges

  • 
        TODO: check draft versions
        - Variation in inflexion/Flexemes :: use to dialectal, diachronic or
        simply orthographic variation. Examples

      □ 
            In Latin, lavo `wash can be inflected according to either the 1st
            (lavare)

    or the 3rd (lavere) conjugation.

  • 
        Suppletion, eg in Old English, the verb wesan `to be' whose infinitive

    represents one underlying root, whereas its indicative present singular
    forms

    are based on two other roots (eom 1.sg. `(I) am'; bist 2.sg. `(you) are').

  • 
        Modern Greek, `τραίνο' and `τρένο' have the same meaning and syntactic
        behaviour, so they can be modeled as the same ontolex:LexicalEntry,
        where the inflected forms of each are grouped together instead of all
        of them being represented as simply ontolex:otherForm. The current
        proposal is to introduce a new relation for orthographic variation (\
        onto{lexis:OrthVariant}) as a subclass of \onto
        {vartrans:LexicalRelation} and relate the orthographic variants through
        this relation.

    - Markers of morphological variation :: labels of style, dating, dialect,
    etc.

  • 
        Resolved by transfering the issue to LexInfo Vocabulary

  • 
        Note :: it would be desirable if the OntoLex-Morph vocabulary would
        eventually be accompanied by best practice recommendations for the
        assignment of markers and provenance.

    - Challenges in word formation ::

  • 
        not fully predictable phonological processes like assimilation or
        apophony, which prevent the simple juxtaposition of formative elements
        from generating the actual surface form of derivatives;

  • 
        formal and semantic constraints that make a word formation rule not
        applicable to all the words in the lexicon with a specific part of
        speech.

Requirements (from wiki)

                                N1: Morph resources

    Description: In order to represent morphemic elements that do not apply to
     the restrictive definition of ontolex:Affix as being ontolex:LexicalEntry
      resources, a distinct class morphMorph is required as another top-level
    class next to ontolex:LexicalEntry and ontolex:Form. Moreover, with regard
        to a future etymology OntoLex module, it could serve as a means to
      represent data that has been identified and should be pointed to but to
     which no further detailed knowledge exists yet but might be added later.

                        Required vocabulary: owl:Class
                     Initial consensus: approved modeling:

             morph:Morph a owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing .

     Status Updates: as of 2021, we shifted towards modelling morph:Morphs as
     subclasses of ontolex:LexicalEntry. This was done to eliminate redundancy
                     in morph-level form and sense attributes.

  • 

                           N2: Specific morph resources

    Description: Next to main morph:Morph class, more specific morph resources
      should be representable. For morphological representation, the elements
    root and stem should be assignable to classes. Further a morph:Affix class
     is required in parallel to ontolex:Affix to enable the representation of
      morphs that are not considered ontolex:LexicalEntry resources. Further,
        more specific affix types such as transfix (a discontinuous affix),
     simulfix (change or replacement of vowels or consonants (usually vowels)
    which changes the meaning of a word) and zero morph (a morpheme that has a
      morphological meaning that corresponds to no overt form) which are not
         covered by other existing RDF vocabularies are required as well.

                               Language example:

          English Simulfix: a-->e in man (singular) vs. men (plural)

  Hebrew Transfix:grammatical information is encoded in a discontinuous vowel
pattern that is applied to a consonantic root pattern. E.g. the transfix a-a-a
 (third person, singular, past) is inserted into the root k-t-b 'all concepts
      evolving around writing' to render the word-form kataba 'he wrote'.

 German Zero Morph: case and gender are not overtly marked in the German noun
 Herr 'master' and, thus, correspond to no overt form. The morpheme NOM.SG is
realized by the zero morph Ø (i.e. Herr-Ø (at morph level) vs. ‘master-NOM.SG’
                             (at morpheme level)).

                          Required vocabulary: owl:Class

                     Initial consensus: approved modeling:

                  current modeling with fixed set of classes

   mor ph:RootMorph, morph:StemMorph, morph:AffixMorph, morph:TransfixMorph,
      morph:SimulfixMorph, morph:ZeroMorph rdfs:subClassOf morph:Morph .

     Status Updates: The need is agreed upon, but as of early 2022, we decided
    to move the subclassification of morphs into Lexinfo. This is because this
       hierarchy is partially provided in LexInfo v. 3.0, already, and users
     should not be confused with having multiple namespaces for information of
          the same kind (e.g., lexinfo:Suffix alongside morph:Simulfix).

  • 

     N3: Differentiation between derivational and inflectional morph resources

       Description: With regard to representing the morphological content of
     lexical data the destinction between word-form forming (inflectional) and
     lexeme-forming (derivational) morph:Morph resources should be expressible
     and extractable. Concomitantly, the existing limitation of ontolex:Affix
    resources to represent only the latter type of morphs (due to its subclass
                relation to ontolex:LexicalEntry) will be overcome.

                               Language example:

                          German (homonym) suffixes:

    1) -er: an inlectional affix forming comparative adjectives, e.g. schön
                   'beautiful' --> schöner 'more beautiful'

 2) -er: a derivational affix forming agent nouns from verbs, e.g. fahren 'to
                          drive' --> Fahrer 'driver'

     Required vocabulary: Explicit identification of morph:Morph resources as
                   being an inflectional or derivational morph.

                     Initial consensus: initial modeling:

                morph:Morph morph:hasMorphStatus morph:Value .

                      morph:derivational a morph:Value .

                      morph:inflectional a morph:Value .

    Status Updates: 2021/2022: The need is agreed upon, but with the inclusion
       of data from the LinkingLatin project, we shifted towards class-based
       modelling, i.e., WordFormationRule (resp. WordFormationRelation) vs.
     InflectionRule. Furthermore, we encode the difference between compounding
       and derivation in subclasses of WordFormationRule, resp. (partially)
                              WordFormationRelation.

                              current modelling:

         [a morph:WordFormationRule ] morph:involves [a morph:Morph ].

          [a morph:CompoundingRule ] morph:involves [a morph:Morph ].

          [a morph:DerivationRule ] morph:involves [a morph:Morph ].

         [a morph:WordFormationRelation ] morph:wordFormationRule [ a
           morph:DerivationRule; morph:involves [ a morph:Morph ]] .

 Note that here, we don't model the difference as a property of the morph, but
       as a property of the analysis and via morph:WordFormationRelation

  • 

                             N4: Inflectional paradigm

          Description: Lexical data contains pointers to and/or tables of
    inflectional paradigms or classes including the respective stem affixes or
           the full word-forms. Both, the pointers to paradigms and the
        interconnection of word-forms that belong to a paradigm, should be
                                  representable.

                               Language example:

      Greek assignment of a lexical entry to an inflection class: λόγος:

                               mounce-morphcat: n-2a

Greek inflectional class paradigm: (with reconstructed underlying stem endings
                            and desinence) n-3e(3):

                               NS: -ευς {-εϝ+ς}

                               GS: -εως {-εϝ+ος}

                                DS: -ει {-εϝ+ι}

                                AS: -εα {-εϝ+α}

                                VS: -ευ {-εϝ+}

                               NP: -εις {-εϝ+ες}

                               VP: -εις {-εϝ+ες}

                               GP: -εων {-εϝ+ων}

                              DP: -ευσι {-εϝ+σι}

                                 AP: -εις {-εϝ+ας}

           N5: Morphology crosses part-of-speech boundaries (derivation)

    Description: John (Issue derived from "Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural
             Language Processing" by Emily Bender, Source: <https ://
        www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00493ED1V01Y201303HLT020>)

                               Language example:

 Morphological processes can turn one part-of-speech into another, effectively
                       creating a distinct LexicalEntry

                                    English

                                       • 
                       "to play" (verb) => "played" (adjective)

                                       • 
                       "to play" (verb) => "the playing" (noun)

                             Required vocabulary:

            ontolex:LexicalEnty ontolex:lexicalForm ontolex:Form .

                ontolex:Form morph:consistsOf morph:ZeroMorph .

                                  Tested on data:

                           Status: agreed modelling

  CC: This should include "zero derivation", where one word receives another
part-of-speech without any difference in form or meaning. As an example, every
German adjective can be used as adverb, most English prepositions also occur as
  subordinating conjunctions (complementizers) and verbal particles, etc. For
"zero morphology", a distinct LexicalEntry is necessary only if differences in
sense can be established. The underlying issue is that OntoLex does not permit
   more than one part-of-speech per LexicalEntry (which would be the natural
                                modeling here).

     Bettina: Derivation should be expressable at least as the underlying
 word-formation process. Whether the three different types of derivation (i.e.
   1) zero derivation, 2) word-class changing derivation with no additional
 meaning and 3) word-class changing derivation with additional meaning) should
          be expressable depends on the needs of the lexicographers.

Current draft: use established means for derivation to represent conversion and
                    specify zero morph, e.g. “play” (noun):

                      descriptive/extensional modelling:

             ex:play_v_rel_play_n a morph:WordFormationRelation ;

                      vartrans:source ex:lex_play_verb ;

                      vartrans:target ex:lex_play_noun .

          ex:lex_play_noun ontolex:lexicalForm ex:form_play_noun_sg .

      ex:lex_play_noun rdfs:member|morph:consistsOf ex:lex_play_verb, [a
                              morph:ZeroMorph ].

                     or generative/intensional modelling:

             ex:play_v_rel_play_n a morph:WordFormationRelation ;

                      vartrans:source ex:lex_play_verb ;

                      vartrans:target ex:lex_play_noun .

          ex:lex_play_noun ontolex:lexicalForm ex:form_play_noun_sg .

ex:play_v_rel_play_n morph:wordFormationRule/morph:involves [a morph:ZeroMorph
                                      ].

                       N6: Morphs linked to Lexical Entries

    Description: Many dictionaries contain information about the morphology of
     a headword. This is typically given relative to the lemma. A possibility
      should be provided that enables an explicit statement of word-forms or
          morphemic elements that are given as part of the lexical entry.

                               Language example:

    German(from "Langenscheidt Taschenwörterbuch Deutsch als Fremdsprache":

                                       • 
                                 Bedingung die; -, -en

                                       • 
                               Bedürfnis das; -ses, -se

                                       • 
                             Beitrag der; -(e)s, Beiträge

  Note the does not cover all forms of the German noun, e.g., "Bedürfnissen",
                                  "Beiträgen"

     It should be possible to model this information with two conditions:

                                       1.
        It is not necessary to materialize all forms of the word, instead only
         the relevant stems and minimal set of inflected forms or inflectional
                                       morphemes

                                       2.
             It is possible to generate any form in a programmatic manner

       JMC: question is if we can underspecify the morphological pattern

       Required vocabulary: 1. reuse vocabulary for automatic generation of
      word-forms and 2. create new property with ontolex:LexicalEntry in its
     domain to explicitly state which word-forms and/or morphs or grammatical
             information are considered custom extensions of a lemma.

                                Tested on data:
          Status: unclear if this representation need should be kept

Look up TEI representation: <h ttps://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/

                               Telco 09.06.2021:

Proposal: Object property morph:morphologicalForm could be created (in parallel
to ontolex:lexicalForm) with domain ontolex:LexicalEntry and range morph:Morph

→ different positions on whether this should be representable in the module at
all because all information/data is already covered with the vocabulary and it
    is a need of space-restricted print dictionaries - discuss again later!

    Status 07.09.2022: This can be done via morph:morphologicalPattern and
 morph:paradigm. However, THERE IS NO DIRECT LINK between morph:InflectionRule
and morph:Morph, so this would be represented as string replacements, only, not
                                  as morphs.

                       N7: Multiple segmentation strategies

    Description: Way to allow more than 1 segmentation of a single ontolex:Form

                               Language example:

    The segmentation of lexical entries or wordforms varies with different
                                 granularity:

                          German verb jagte "hunted"

                    Complete segmentation: root-stem-suffix

          [[[jag]-t]-e] - [[[root]tense suffix]number suffix]wordform

                     Contracted segmentation: stem-suffix

             [[jagt]-e] - [[past tense stem]number suffix]wordform

                               Required vocabulary:

                                Tested on data:
                            Status: to be discussed

Christian: Does occur in Splett's Old High German dictionary (https://brill.com
/view/journals/abag/42/1/article-p264_28.xml): Here, full morphological parses
  (tree structures) are being used. The other (main) use case is in language
   documentation (with Toolbox, from which dictionaries are being created):
Linguistic glossing can operate on a superficial level or on a deep level, cf.
   German fressen ("to eat, of an animal") which superficially involves two
 morphemes (fress- + -en), but on a deep level involves three (*ver- + ess- +
  -en, *ver- contributing the derogative [non-human] meaning as in verwerfen
"reject", lit. "cast away"). Normally, while one dictionary may chose one level
 of depth, another dictionary may chose another. Admitting more than one level
   of depth allows to merge information from different sources in a coherent
      representation. Wrt. morphological pattern: Isn't the idea that the
morphological pattern describes a context for one given morph(eme)? So if have
  more than one (-t- and -e-) here, how will be formalize their combination?

    Petra Steiner (7.9.2022): need for modelling derivation trees ((A B) C)
                                  confirmed.

  Current recommendation: model with decomp, no designated vocabulary needed
HOWEVER: not clear whether this supports multiple concurrent segmentations in a
                            single data structure.

                         N11: Meanings of stems and roots

    Description: Link morphs and senses. For roots or stems with lexical senses
          or lexical concepts, e.g., for semantic fields of roots , e.g.,
    reconstructed protoforms (resp., their meaning) [why is Morph not a Lexical
                                      Entry?]

                               Language example:

 The meaning of stems and roots differ in the former are language-specific and
 the latter language-independent concepts. Stems have a word-class affiliation
 and often also entail grammatical information like tense and number (inherent
inflectional meanings). As they function as the underlying semantic core of the
  lexical entry they occur in, the meanings of stems could be treated as the
meanings of lexical entries. Roots, however, comprise very unspecific meanings
              from which words of various wordforms can be built.

Hebrew root k-t-b conveys the concept "anything related to writing". From this
     root nouns and verbs can be build, e.g. to write, journalist, author.

                             Required vocabulary:

                                ` ‘sense’ property

      domain: ontolex:LexicalEntry, morph:StemMorph and morph:RootMorph `

                         range: 'sense' concept class

                                  Tested on data:

                      Initial proposal: modeled as draft:

 Bettina: The description of meanings of stems and roots could be realized in
  the same way as the description of meanings of lexical entries as given in
   ontolex. For the representation of roots maybe external resources such as
    Concepticon could be recommended or the possibility of a plain textual
                 definition could be established in addition.

 Discussed proposal: Extend domain of ontolex:sense with ontolex:LexicalEntry
                   and morph:StemMorph and morph:RootMorph.

JMC: not in favour of extending ontolex:sense domain with morph:Morph, proposes
 new property morph:sense with ontolex:LexicalSense and another Concept class.

   JBG: With the use of ontolex:LexicalSense we are assuming an ontological
  reference, so we might run into the same problems as the ones we found when
 converting dictionaries (which ontological references to point to?). Since in
the lexicog specification we opted to stick to ontolex:LexicalConcepts for the
meaning of lexical entries in the conversion of dict entries to LLD, why would
      we want to point to LexicalSense in this case, instead of Concept?

      Current draft: property morph:sense with morph:Morph in domain and
                         ontolex:LexicalSense in range

                         object property: morph:sense

                          range: ontolex:LexicalSense

       Status: solved: use OntoLex core vocabulary, as morph:Morph is now a
                                   LexicalEntry

                            N12: Derivational Meanings

             Language Processing" by Emily Bender, Source: <http s://
         www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00493ED1V01Y201303HLT020>

                               Language example:

 Diminutives create a new noun with a meaning of being smaller, this could be
  modelled by means of adding a small classes to the meaning of a noun. Three
  types of derivational meanings should be considered: Conversion: word-class
 change with no affxal marking and no additional meaning, e.g. play (v) → play
                                      (n)

Derivation 1: word-class change with affxal marking and no additional meaning,
                          e.g. play (v) → playing (n)

    Derivation 2: with or without word-class change with affxal marking and
    additional meaning, e.g. book (n) → booklet (n), play (v) → player (n)

      Required vocabulary: class for representing derivational meanings, e.g.
                             morph:DerivationalConcept

                                Tested on data:
                           Status: modeled as draft:

Diminuitives are not an ideal example because they are sometimes considered to
   be inflectional rather than semantic features (a form of degree, such as
   comparative). A better example might be the English morpheme "-er" which
   attaches to a verb to form a noun that represents the agent. The classic
         representation is by means of a rule: V + "-er" => N_ag (CC)

John: Model derivational meanings as concepts and link morph instances to this
                                   concept.

 Fahad: Ignore examples with lexicalized words (e.g. computer). We do not need
                to model too deeply - just state “diminutive”.

John: Proposes to have DerivationalConcept as subclass of ontolex:Concept (but
                   no need for InflectionaConcept subclass).

      Current draft: property morph:evokes with morph:Morph in domain and
                        ontolex:LexicalConcept in range

                         object property: morph:evokes

                              domain: morph:Morph

      morph:DerivationalConcept rdfs:subClassOf ontolex:LexicalConcept .

             N13: “missing” part of the stem becomes a separate token

    Description: I think there is a need to allow for morphology to break up a
    stem. I see John has raised a similar issue in N9, but what I am suggesting
    is that some tokens represent reduced forms of the stem/headword, but that
             the “missing” part of the stem becomes a separate token.

                               Language example:

                       Eg. Old Irish verbs like do-beir:

 1. Prototonic form is tabair (a verb), with the ta- mapping to the do- of the
        stem. 2. Deuterotonic form is do + beir (a particle + a verb).

In this case, while the headword, do-beir contains do-, the morphological form
   does not, and do- exists as a separate particle token. Pronouns can come
     between the particle and the verb and this is not considered tmesis.

    Required vocabulary: class for representing free and/or grammatical morphs
       and an object property that allows statements to express that a free/
       grammatical morph is part of an ontolex:Form or a complex morph:Morph

                              range: morph:Morph

            N15: Lexeme generation takes LexicalEntry and Form as input

    Description: The generation of ontolex:LexicalEntry resources should allow
    to take resources of the type ontolex:LexicalEntry as well as ontolex:Form
      as input sources. This is required for languages which form new lexemes
    with inflected word-forms. One example is compounding in German, where the
      modifier takes on inflected forms (e.g., Gäste+haus "guest house", lit.
                            "guests' house" [plural]).

                               Language example:
           Required vocabulary: morph:consistOf range: ontolex:Form
                                Tested on data:
                      initial proposal: modeled as draft:

 The object properties vartrans:source and vartrans:target are reused and the
 range of morph:consistOf will not be extended to ontolex:Form. Any word-forms
involved in the source or target of a generated ontolex:LexicalEntry have to be
                  expressed by using morph:WordFormationRule.

                                vartrans:source

                                vartrans:target

                            morph:WordFormationRule

 current status: to be droppen? no real data. extension of vartrans:source is
        possible but beyond scope (in vartrans). We'd need to suggest a
                    vartrans:LexicalRelation between forms.

   In German linguistics, an alternative view on compounding with inflected
modifiers has been advocated, i.e., that the (diachronic) inflection now serves
as interfix. This is supported by the fact that these "inflections" lost their
  grammatical meaning, so there is German Gästehaus (guest house) along with
Gasthaus (restaurant), but the difference in meaning has nothing to do with the
              singular or plural morpheme that acts as interfix.
