TODO@MI, CC: Finish the changes, submit the chapter until the 31.07

1. Paradigm class

MP: Naming “paradigm” may evoke incorrect associations, definition of paradigm
in linguistics as a set of word forms

    Note: we also need to rephrase the “paradigm” property, then

  • 
        morphological pattern

  • 
        Inflection type?

  • 
        Inflection class?

      □ 
            MP: +1

      □ 
            GS: sounds like owl class

  • 
        Inflection?

    => hard to get to a consensus, vote?

MP: paradigm → rules instead of the other way around

option 1:

morph:Paradigm > morph:InflectionClass, morph:paradigm > morph:inflectionClass

option 2:

morph:Paradigm > morph:MorphologicalPattern, morph:paradigm >
morph:isInflectionRuleOf (or morph:InflectionRule, changing the direction of
the arrow (i.e., going from morph:MorphologicalPattern to morph:InflectionRule
rather than the opposite)

MI: This was exactly the idea behind the current class. Maybe just rephrase the
definition? (also, see MP remarks)

Cf. requirement N4: Lexical data contains pointers to and/or tables of
inflectional paradigms or classes including the respective stem affixes or the
full word-forms. Both, the pointers to paradigms and the interconnection of
word-forms that belong to a paradigm, should be representable.

MI: No problem with option 2, we need to find a way to see if everyone else is
on board.

MP: Slight preference with option 1, but option 2 is also okay.

MI: Maybe rethink InflectionType name (InflectionSlot may be more intuitive)
and then go for option 1

TODO@MI: discuss this CC, how to best come to a decision within the community

2. Finite State terminology

  • 
        Some of the aspects of the module allow it to model FST, albeit it
        might feel like a misuse (e.g. InflectionType as a state)

  • 
        Finite state terminology

      □ 
            Options: either within morph or within the scope of a new module?

          ☆ 
                If the latter:

              ○ 
                    Together with diachrony?

              ○ 
                    Together with sound classes?

  • 
        MI: Probably best keep it the way it is and FSTs can be implemented in
        a different module or another vocabulary outside of OntoLex, since it’s
        out of scope kinda

      □ 
            KG: +1

  • 
        CC: Treat it like the sound classes/character sounds — a (small)
        vocabulary out of morph, out of scope but motivated by morph

3. Open questions from the LDL paper

  • 
        - Variation in inflexion/Flexemes :: use to dialectal, diachronic or
        simply orthographic variation. Examples

      □ 
            In Latin, lavo `wash can be inflected according to either the 1st
            (lavare)

    or the 3rd (lavere) conjugation.

  • 
        Suppletion, eg in Old English, the verb wesan `to be' whose infinitive

    represents one underlying root, whereas its indicative present singular
    forms

    are based on two other roots (eom 1.sg. `(I) am'; bist 2.sg. `(you) are').

  • 
        Modern Greek, `τραίνο' and `τρένο' have the same meaning and syntactic
        behaviour, so they can be modeled as the same ontolex:LexicalEntry,
        where the inflected forms of each are grouped together instead of all
        of them being represented as simply ontolex:otherForm. The current
        proposal is to introduce a new relation for orthographic variation (\
        onto{lexis:OrthVariant}) as a subclass of \onto
        {vartrans:LexicalRelation} and relate the orthographic variants through
        this relation.

  • 
        MP: we can treat it as resolved. MP used Flexemes in his modeling but
        that was dataset-specific, and not necessary for the Morph module

    See the slides here: https://zenodo.org/record/8036909

    - Markers of morphological variation :: labels of style, dating, dialect,
    etc.

  • 
        Resolved by transfering the issue to LexInfo Vocabulary

  • 
        Note :: it would be desirable if the OntoLex-Morph vocabulary would
        eventually be accompanied by best practice recommendations for the
        assignment of markers and provenance.

    - Challenges in word formation ::

  • 
        not fully predictable phonological processes like assimilation or
        apophony, which prevent the simple juxtaposition of formative elements
        from generating the actual surface form of derivatives;

  • 
        formal and semantic constraints that make a word formation rule not
        applicable to all the words in the lexicon with a specific part of
        speech.

    (morph:GrammanticalMeaning??)

  • 
        CC: morph:baseConstraint should have resolved this

4. W3C day presentation

  • 
        https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/W3c_community_day_@_LDK2023

CC: We can’t come up with a list of requirements right now because we still
have open questions

  • 
        TODO@MI: go through all the requirements and give an overview of what
        is left

  • 
        TODO@CC, MI: discuss what is left

  • 
        Still TODO

Next time

  • 
        Summer break

  • 
        Close open TODOs, especially, the ones from the last section: CC&MI to
        discuss what’s left and compile a list

  • 
        Restarting before LDK? 6.09? 20.09?

      □ 
            FK: We have Nexus plenary, so not 6.09
