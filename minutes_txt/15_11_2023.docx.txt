        Removed ??? from morph:grammaticalMeaning. We can support this property
        for morph:InflectonType (we might discuss this today if we have time)

1. CC: Inuktikut data and problems with LexicalEntries

https://github.com/acoli-repo/morph-addenda/tree/master/data/polysynthetic

The problem: ambiguity in word formation — https://github.com/acoli-repo/
morph-addenda/tree/master/data/polysynthetic#5-encode-ambiguity-in-derivation

Discussion:

  • 
        Example atausiulugu

      □ 
            This is an inflected word, but the inflection part is
            unproblematic. The word formation part is challenging, and that
            part would also be relevant for a dictionary.

  • 
        Can a morph:Morph have more than one form?

      □ 
            CC: inuktitut morph. Segmentation provides canonical form of affix
            along with current string realization. How to model that?
            (proposal: multiple forms of the same morph)

      □ 
            If yes, this could be used to represent (some cases of) allomorphy

      □ 
            MI: original consensus to not require morph:Morphs to be morphemes,
            morpheme handling within Mmoon

  • 
        Allomorphy

      □ 
            MI: one morph:Morph per form, relate allomorphs indirectly by
            repurposing grammatical meaning (i.e., one Morpheme=one grammatical
            meaning)

      □ 
            CC: redundancy and information loss, incompatible with otherForms
            for other lexical entries.

      □ 
            MI: if morphophonological, then just provide rules instead of
            segments

      □ 
            CC: we cannot require everyone who wants to give a morphological
            segmentation to write a morphological analyzer

  • 
        CC: Instead of forms being a sequence of morphs, model them as a
        sequence of forms (example below), otherwise we lose information about
        the realization of a morph(eme) at a particular position

      □ 
            If allomorphs are modelled as alternative forms of the same
            underlying morph(eme), this allows us to provide information about
            the specific form variant of a morph used as a particular position
            in a particular word without having to write full-fledged
            assimilation rules

      □ 
            This means to allows one ontolex:Form to be a rdfs:Seq of
            ontolex:Forms (rather morph:Morphs). No changes to morph:contains

      □ 
            MI: leads to problems with downward compatibility

      □ 
            CC: if we don’t arrive at a consensus here, we could skip the
            rdfs:Seq part of forms, because this is nothing defined in morph
            namespace anyway

  • 
        MI: Next meeting supposed to be the last regular morph meeting

      □ 
            FK: really? MI: There may be irregular meetings

Note on incorporating verbs like :u_1_le

  • 
        Morphologically, these behave like affixes, but semantically, they are
        lexical verbs. These really need to be lexical entries.

Note on allomorphy:

  • 
        Except for the stem atausi-, all morphemes in this example happen to
        take the canonical form, but they have other allomorphic variants. By
        allowing ontolex:otherForm for the these variants, adding a new variant
        requires two triples (ontolex:otherForm and ontolex:writtenRep – the
        others can be inferred). Creating a separate lexical entry for atausi
        means that it and its sense have to be completely duplicated. Also,
        there is no direct link between the allomorphic variants. Same for -ut-
        and its variant -u-, for -uq- and its variant -u-, for -liq- and its
        variants -siq-, -si- and -li-, etc. (depending on following morpheme,
        final consonants can be assimilated. But this is described with the
        following morpheme, see https://github.com/acoli-repo/morph-addenda/
        blob/master/data/polysynthetic/atausiulugu.morphs.ttl).

  • 
        As for how that would be presented in a dictionary, see https://

Post-call addendum

  • 
        As requested by Max, a comparison of the modelling with forms being
        rdfs:Seq of forms resp. Morphs under https://github.com/acoli-repo/

                incl. linking of contextual variant with canonical form (via
                otherForm)

      □ 
            directory every-form-one-morph/

          ☆ 
                Information loss: no linking between different form variants
                yet

Agenda:

  • 
        Confirm that all the datasets are compatible
